I'm Matt Drake. I'm a full-stack developer in the Washington, D.C. metro area.

In past lives, I've been a network engineer, data analyst, and non-commissioned
officer.

I don't think credentials are a high-fidelity indicator, but in case you do: I
have a degree in economics (math minor) and I'm working on one in computer
science.

For fun, I like to design games, read, and go to live music. You can also find
me at Nationals games, nerding out with my awesome wife.

You can also catch me streaming programming on
