I'm Matt Drake. I'm a software developer in the Washington, D.C. metro area.

In past lives, I've been a network engineer, data analyst, and non-commissioned
officer.

For fun, I like to design games, read, and see live music. You can also find
me at baseball games, nerding out with my awesome wife. Go Nats!

I also like to program on [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/mdrakedev).
