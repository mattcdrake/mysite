I'm Matt Drake. I'm a full-stack developer in the Washington, D.C. metro area.

In past lives, I've been a network engineer, data analyst, and non-commissioned
officer.

I don't think most credentials serve as valuable indicators. In case you do, I
have a degree in economics (math minor) and I'm working on one in computer
science.

For fun, I like to design games, read, and see live music. You can also find
me at baseball games, nerding out with my awesome wife. Go Nats!
