# Reading Notes (May 2020 - August 2020)

## _Invisible Cities_, Italo Calvino

_Invisible Cities_ is a book of vignettes interlacing a conversation between
Kublai Khan and Marco Polo.

I took the same approach with this book that I would have taken with a book of
poetry - digesting one story at a time. Some sessions, I'd only read about one
or two cities because of how moving the description might have been. With
others, I didn't find them as moving, so I moved on more quickly. Whether a
given scene is compelling or not is likely up to the reader, but I will say
that each scene is fully _realized_. Even the cities that I didn't find as
powerful still had a distinct mood.

I strongly recommend reading this.

## _Deep Work_, Cal Newport

I've _Deep Work_ before but I wanted to revisit it, because I have lost the
way. The book is pretty good for motivating you to scrutinize your work habits
to see if you can wring more productivity out of less time. Some of the
arguments and data seem pretty flimsy. Overall, I think there is plenty of good
advice in here and I would recommend it to anyone looking to fine-tune your
work habits.
