# Advent of Code 2019 - Day 7

## Intro

Day 7 brings another Intcode puzzle, so I finally bit the bullet and refactored
my vm. I'm writing this after reading the prompt for day 9, so I'm getting the
sense more refactoring might be coming soon. For now, let's cover day 7's
solution.

As always, you can find my full solutions repo 
[here](https://github.com/mattcdrake/aoc19-python).

## Solution

The main thing I've done to refactor my Intcode vm is to encapsulate it inside
a class. The instance will now keep track of the program counter and the
internal memory/program. The primary interface to the class is the
`compute(inputs)` method, which takes a list of inputs and returns an output
value and an associated code ("halt" or "output"). This problem requires you to
use previous outputs as inputs to the next amp, so I had to modify the `compute`
method accordingly.

With the new Intcode computer, the rest of the part one falls into place easily.
Generate all permuations of amp settings and then iterate through them, using
the vm to compute the max thrust.

```py
phase_settings = list(permutations([0, 1, 2, 3, 4], 5))
max_thrust = -1
program = prep_intcode_program("./input/day7.txt")

for amp_config in phase_settings:
    line_in = 0
    for amp in amp_config:
        computer = IntcodeComputer(program.copy())
        line_in, halt_type = computer.compute([amp, line_in])
        line_in = line_in
    if line_in > max_thrust:
        max_thrust = line_in
```

The second part throws a wrench into the puzzle by requiring you to pass one
amp's output into the next amp's input. This is the spec change that made me
have to do a refactor that allowed for output but retained the instance's
program counter.

I'm using the same general approach of iterating through possibile amp
configurations and comparing the final 5th amp output to the max seen thusfar.
This is pretty messy, but I'm __getting shit done__ over here.

```py
for amp_config in phase_settings:
    first_run = True
    found = False
    amps = [IntcodeComputer(program.copy()) for i in range(0, 5)]
    amp_id = 0
    last_e_signal = -1
    line_in = 0

    while not found or amp_id != 0:
        if first_run:
            line_in = [amp_config[amp_id], line_in]
        else:
            line_in = [line_in]

        line_in, halt_type = amps[amp_id].compute(line_in)

        if halt_type == "output" and amp_id == 4:
            last_e_signal = line_in

        if halt_type == "halt":
            found = True

        if amp_id == 4:
            first_run = False

        amp_id = (amp_id + 1) % 5

    if last_e_signal > max_thrust:
        max_thrust = last_e_signal
```

Hopefully this version of the Intcode vm will be more extensible for future
Intcode puzzles.
