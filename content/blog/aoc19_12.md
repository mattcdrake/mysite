# Advent of Code 2019 - Day 12

This was a nice puzzle, even though I got stuck on the second half for a couple
days. I tried a couple wrong approaches to storing and looking up previous
states - namely binary trees and dictionary keys with a try/catch lookup.

Eventually, I caved and looked up a hint on 
[reddit](https://reddit.com/r/adventofcode). One commenter laid out helpful
insights (the main one being that the repeated state __must__ be the initial
state, because all future states are children of the first) in a way that the
problem was still interesting to solve.

## Adding Up Energy

The first part went smoothly since implementing the solution is mostly just
following the instructions. I made a `Body` class that had the required
behavior and kept a list of 4 of them to simulate the moons.

```py
class Body:
    # Position {'x': n, 'y': n, 'z': n}
    def __init__(self, position):
        self.initial_pos = position.copy()
        self.position = position
        self.velocity = {'x': 0, 'y': 0, 'z': 0}

    def update_velocity(self, velocity):
        self.velocity['x'] += velocity['x']
        self.velocity['y'] += velocity['y']
        self.velocity['z'] += velocity['z']

    def update_position(self):
        self.position['x'] += self.velocity['x']
        self.position['y'] += self.velocity['y']
        self.position['z'] += self.velocity['z']
```

The code for advancing the simulation by a step is simple enough. 
`update_velocities(body1, body2)` finds the delta for each velocity axis and
then applies it to both bodies. `update_position()` applies each body's
velocity to its position.

```py
def advance_time(bodies):
    for i in range(0, len(bodies)):
        for j in range(i+1, len(bodies)):
            update_velocities(bodies[i], bodies[j])

    for body in bodies:
        body.update_position()
```

To find the energy, just iterate through each body and sum the absolute value of
each position & velocity axis.

## The Hard Part

The second part was much tougher for me. Both methods of storing and comparing
historical values that I tried (trees and state as dictionary keys) was slow.
With these approaches, the simulation was completing between 1.4m-2.3m steps
in 30 seconds. Given that the example required 4-ish billion steps - this was
way too slow.

I beat my head on the wall for a long time on this problem and eventually gave
in and got a hint off the AoC reddit. A nice user pointed out that:

a) The repeated state must be the same as the initial state, and
b) You can find the period of each axis individually

Wow! Those are both great insights that make the correct approach so much
clearer. Another thing this puzzle taught me is that I should spend more time
considering approaches from a logical/math viewpoint. Doing so could give a lot
of insight into what needs to be computed in the first place.

Without further ado, here is my solution for part 2.

```py
def found_all_steps(steps):
    for i in range(3):
        if steps[i] < 0:
            return False
    return True


def is_same_state(bodies, axis):
    found = []
    for i in range(4):
        same_pos = bodies[i].position[axis] == bodies[i].initial_pos[axis]
        same_vel = bodies[i].velocity[axis] == 0
        found.append(same_pos and same_vel)
    return all(found)

bodies = parse_input("./input/day12.txt")
axes = ['x', 'y', 'z']
steps = [-1, -1, -1]
step_ct = 0
while not found_all_steps(steps):
    advance_time(bodies)
    step_ct += 1
    for index, axis in enumerate(axes):
        if steps[index] < 0 and is_same_state(bodies, axis):
            steps[index] = step_ct

print("part 2: " + str(lcm.reduce(steps)))
```

The key is to find the first step at which each axis repeats and then find the
least common multiple (I'm using [numpy](https://numpy.org/devdocs/reference/generated/numpy.lcm.html)
for this).

Next time, I'm going to do more thinking and less coding when something seems
like the obviously wrong path.
