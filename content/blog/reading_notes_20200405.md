# Reading Notes (February 2020 - April 2020)

## _How to Win Friends and Influence People_, Dale Carnegie

I see this book recommended often, and I always dismissed it because of the horrible title. Something about it seems dishonest and manipulative, like it's for training sociopaths to blend in with regular people. The message of the book is much better than that and although much of this advice is commonplace, it does a good job of teaching each principle via anecdotes. If you look past the weird name, clickbait chapter titles, and contrived examples, there is a wealth of knowledge here.

## _Eloquent JavaScript, 3rd Edition_, Marjin Haverbeke

Before reading this book, my JavaScript skills were pretty amorphous. I can hack my way around but I dind't have a deep understanding of _why_ I was doing anything. Things like callbacks, binding functions in class constructors, and Object prototypes are all examples of things that I (kinda) knew how to use but I didn't have a deep understanding of why they worked.

I don't get frustrated by encountering weird syntax (arrow functions, spread syntax, object destructuring, the list goes on) anymore! 

I know how `async/await` and promises work! 

This book has leveled up my JavaScript skills so much, and I would recommend this book to anyone else with a fuzzy (and obviously incomplete) understanding of JavaScript.

## _Increment Issue 11, "Teams"_, Stripe Press

I don't know where this publication fits on the magazine/trade rag/journal continuum, but I really enjoyed reading it. A few of the articles are pretty blatant marketing pieces but most of them have a high signal:noise ratio. I'm looking forward to reading issues that have a more technical focus - I'm sure that the quality will still be great.

One downside is that they don't seem to offer a PDF. I would happily pay for a high quality PDF but don't really want to buy all the back issues at $14 a pop. They _do_ offer all the content for free as a website, but the layout design and flow of the magazine was so great - I don't want to miss out because it's on a website. This is really a minor nitpick, I definitely recommend checking out this publication.
