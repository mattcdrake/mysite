# Reading Notes (March 2020 - April 2020)

## _How to Win Friends and Influence People_, Dale Carnegie

I see this book recommended often, and I always dismissed it because of the horrible title. Something about it seems dishonest and manipulative, like it's for training sociopaths to blend in with regular people. The message of the book is much better than that and although much of this advice is commonplace, it does a good job of teaching each principle via anecdotes. If you look past the weird name, clickbait chapter titles, and contrived examples, there is a wealth of knowledge here.

## _Eloquent JavaScript, 3rd Edition_, Marjin Haverbeke

Before reading this book, my JavaScript skills were pretty amorphous. I can hack my way around but I dind't have a deep understanding of _why_ I was doing anything. Things like callbacks, binding functions in class constructors, and Object prototypes are all examples of things that I (kinda) knew how to use but had basically no understanding of how/why it worked. 

This book has leveled up my JavaScript skills so much that I can confidently say I like the language. 

I don't get frustrated by encountering weird syntax (arrow functions, spread syntax, object destructuring, the list goes on) anymore! 

I know how `async/await` and promises work! 

It feels great, and I would recommend this book to anyone else with a fuzzy (and obviously incomplete) understanding of JavaScript.
