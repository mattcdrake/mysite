# Reading Notes (March 2020 - April 2020)

## _How to Win Friends and Influence People_, Dale Carnegie

I see this book recommended often, and I always dismissed it because of the horrible title. Something about it seems dishonest and manipulative, like it's for training sociopaths to blend in with regular people. The message of the book is much better than that and although much of this advice is commonplace, it does a good job of teaching each principle via anecdotes. If you look past the weird name, clickbait chapter titles, and contrived examples, there is a wealth of knowledge to gain.
