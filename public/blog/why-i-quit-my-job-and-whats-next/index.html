                <p>Hi, I’m Matt Drake. I’m a network engineer turned data analyst <em>turning</em>
software developer. A couple months ago, I left my public sector R&amp;D job in
order to work on a CS degree full-time and begin a new career as a software
developer. Here, I&rsquo;ll explain my short-term goals and my plan to achieve them.</p>
<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p>I started college after a 4-year detour in the US Army, where I was the
sergeant in charge of a computer networking squad. My first major was CS. I
made A’s in a handful of courses and enjoyed the material. However, I fell in
love with microeconomics and convinced myself that I would do a PhD in
Economics. So, I took as many math and stats classes as I could (that’s what
impresses Econ PhD admissions) and did a bunch of undergrad research. This
helped me learn something important about myself: I don’t like research and I
don’t want to be in academia. It’s great that I learned it, but with a year
left in college, it was a little late.</p>
<p>A BS in Economics isn’t a sure ticket to a job. It’s probably better than
English or Film, but definitely worse than any form of engineering, science, or
<a href="https://harvest.cals.ncsu.edu/agricultural-institute/students/?p=12902">Turf
Management</a>.
I applied to 7 master’s programs in Data Science and got into all of them
except the one I wanted to go to. It seemed dumb to waste thousands of dollars
and a couple years to do a degree I wasn’t excited about, so I got a job as a
data analyst at the Bureau of Economic Analysis. I love economics, they
estimate GDP, what could go wrong?</p>
<p>I worked there for around 2 years and all things considered, it was a positive
experience. I worked on a team responsible for the backend of a survey
processing system. BEA gets a lot of survey responses and the data always needs
cleaning. Even though I wasn’t a developer, I wrote a lot of SQL and Python
code and came to realize that I enjoy using software to solve real world
problems.</p>
<p>If it were financially viable, I would have finished a CS degree at this point.
Instead, I got a different job that required me to do a lot more programming. I
was mostly building internal tools and machine learning pipelines, and I
learned a ton. Ultimately, the environment wasn’t a good fit for me. Most of
the projects culminated in PowerPoint decks that got presented and promptly
forgotten about. I need to be in a role where I’m delivering results in order
to feel good about my workday. Therefore, I’m taking 9 months to finish a CS
bachelor’s degree before starting a new career as a software developer.</p>
<h3 id="why-not-just-work-on-changing-careers-in-my-free-time">Why not just work on changing careers in my free-time?</h3>
<p>For a while, I thought this was the only possible approach. I built some
projects in React/NodeJS after work but it became clear that my pace would take
forever to get to the skill level where I’d be comfortable applying to
engineering roles at Real Companies. I was also fairly inconsistent because I
found my current role so emotionally draining. I work best when I’m all-in, so
I think that’s the best strategy for me to try.</p>
<h3 id="why-earn-a-degree">Why earn a degree?</h3>
<p>I fully believe that it would be possible to get into a software developer role
without doing a CS degree. The fact that so many developers don’t have one is
clear proof of that. The reasons I chose to do one are:</p>
<ul>
<li>A CS curriculum can help me avoid blindspots that I might miss by
self-teaching</li>
<li>The combination of my prior CS credits and the
<a href="https://eecs.oregonstate.edu/academic/online-cs-postbacc">program</a> I’m doing
makes it possible to finish the degree in 9 months</li>
<li>This is a very low opportunity cost to avoid negative perceptions during job
searching</li>
</ul>
<p>The last point is unfortunate and like I said before, I 100% believe that a
degree is not required to be a software developer. But not everyone thinks that
and it seems to be a less common belief among HR people that scan resumes.
There’s an argument that that could actually work as a filter in my benefit -
companies where they filter out non-CS degrees are companies that I wouldn’t
like to work at anyway. That’s entirely posible, but with such a low
opportunity cost (<strong>for me</strong> - I’m not making general statements), it doesn’t
seem like a necessary risk to take.</p>
<h3 id="where-do-you-want-to-work">Where do you want to work?</h3>
<p>I want to work with smart, driven people on software engineering challenges.
I’d prefer to work on a product-focused engineering team, but ops &amp; internal
software are extremely important as well. The team matters a lot more to me
than the product.</p>
<p>That’s it, really. I want to be able to help the project succeed and learn from
awesome co-workers along the way. Big company or startup, I just want to work
with optimistic people that are great at (and care about) their job.</p>
<h2 id="plan">Plan</h2>
<p>The plan has a lot of parts. First, I’m going to finish my CS degree and excel
at it. In addition to coursework, I’m going to launch a few non-trival projects.
I think that this practical experience of
shipping real projects will complement academic work nicely. I have an
incredible opportunity, and I want to wring every drop out of it. Plus, some of
the stuff I build might be good!</p>
<p>I’ve seen a lot of people talk about “learning in public” - I think this is a
fantastic approach and I’m going to do it too. For me, there’s two parts -
streaming and blogging. I’m going to stream on
<a href="https://twitch.tv/mdrakedev">Twitch</a> and my blogs will be right here. Between
the two approaches, I can improve my technical communication skills (verbal and
written) and have fun in the process.</p>
<p>About blogs, there’s more than enough blogspam on the internet. I’m not
interested in writing blogs as though I’m a professional explaining the best
way to do things. I want to write blogs in the style that <a href="https://jvns.ca">Julia
Evans</a> has perfected - just learn something interesting and
then write about it. No clickbait, no edicts, just cool technology.</p>
<p>The last part of the plan is to grind algorithm questions. I dislike it as much
as anyone, but it seems like a reality of the industry and I’d rather be
prepared than not.</p>
<p>That’s it. Wish me luck!</p>
